# Test-Cases Samples

Below are some Test Case samples that I wrote while I was working on previous projects.

-----------------------------------------

**Add products to Wishlist**

**Description**

As a customer, I want to be able to save a product in my wishlist, so that I can view it later.

**Acceptance criteria**

Given that I am a customer, when I click “Save to wishlist” button then the app should save that product in a wishlist.

**View Wishlist**

**Description**

As a customer, I want to be able to view my wishlist so that I can buy items from it.

**Acceptance criteria**

Given that I am a customer, when I click “View my wishlist” button then the app should show me all the products in my wishlist.

**Implement User Login Functionality**

**Description**

As a registered customer, I want to be able to log into the application, so that I can access my personal account.

**Acceptance criteria**

Given that I am a registered customer, when I enter valid creditentials (email + password) and click Login, then I should be redirected to the homepage and see my username in the header.


-----------------------------------------


**Implement Forgot Password Functionality**

**Description**

As a registered customer, I want to be able to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account securely.

**Acceptance criteria**

Given I am on the login page, when I click the “Forgot Password?” link, enter my registered email, and submit, then I receive a password reset link or code that allows me to set a new password, which I can use to log in successfully, and if the email is not registered, I see an “Email not found” error message.
